    <p><em>Chicken Biryani</em> is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved 
        for special occasions such as<BR> weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. 
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. <br>For biryani,
         basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>

    <h2><em>Directions</em></h2>

    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Gather all Ingredients</p>

    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. <br>
        Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.<br>
         Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh<br> 
        ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin<br>,
         chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 4</strong> 
    <p>
        Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook<br> 
        over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may<br> 
        be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to <br>
        stick to the pan.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>
        Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until<br>
         chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy <br>
         left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to <br>
         reduce the gravy.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 6</strong>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 <br>
         minutes.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 7</strong>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom<br>
         pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated<br> 
         with spices. 
    </p>

    <strong>Step 8</strong>
    <p>
        Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 9</strong>
    <p>
        Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 10</strong>
    <p>
        Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes<br>
         without lifting the lid or stirring.
    </p>

    <strong>Step 11</strong>
    <p>
        Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
